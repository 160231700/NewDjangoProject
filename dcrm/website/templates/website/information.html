<h1> Conventional Solutions Information</h1>

<h3> Convenient Solutions: Your Inconvenience, Our Business Model </h3>

<div class="container">
    Mission Statement:  To provide "solutions" that, while technically fulfilling a need, 
    will ultimately complicate your life in delightfully unexpected ways. We strive to create a 
    unique customer experience filled with mild frustration, unexpected delays, and the constant 
    nagging feeling that you've made a terrible mistake.
</div>
<div class="parallax"></div>

<div class="container">
    Vision Statement: A world where "convenience" is a distant memory, replaced by the warm
     embrace of mild panic and the thrill of problem-solving (problems we created, of course).
</div>

<h2> Our "Services": </h2>

<button class="accordion">The "Effortless" Ordering System: </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Our state-of-the-art online platform is designed to keep you guessing.
      Experience the joy of error messages, the frustration of forgotten passwords,
       and the existential dread of wondering if your order actually went through.
         Confirmation emails are purely mythical creatures.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">"Rapid" Delivery: </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We understand the urgency of waiting.  That's why our delivery times are estimates
     at best, and often involve a complex game of "Where's Waldo?" with our drivers.
     Enjoy the suspense!
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">"Helpful" Customer Support: </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Our dedicated team is trained to provide responses that are technically accurate
     but ultimately unhelpful.  Prepare for a labyrinth of automated menus, hold times 
     that defy the laws of physics, and the distinct impression that the person on the 
     other end is actively trying to misunderstand you.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">"Guaranteed" Satisfaction (Terms and Conditions Apply):* </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We're so confident in our ability to disappoint that we offer a satisfaction guarantee...
    with so many asterisks and fine print that even our lawyers haven't read it all.  
    Good luck with that.
  </p>
</div>
